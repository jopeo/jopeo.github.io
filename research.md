# Upcoming Research Study

A crossover study protocol has been developed to assess perspectives on gamified learning in medical education.

This will be conducted remotely, and participants will be provided with a custom-designed add-on package specifically for this study.
Participants will be de-identified and randomized to one of two groups and will study as usual, at their leisure, using Anki.
Gamification features will be enabled for two weeks, and disabled for two weeks, and a short online survey will be administered at three time points:
1. immediately upon enrollment
2. midway through the study
3. at the conclusion of the study
