# Inspiration

 Battle Anki was created during the COVID-19 pandemic by a second-year medical student in preparation for an upcoming
 dedicated USMLE Step 1 study period. 

# Software Development
 
 In response to the quarantine, this software was developed to improve relatedness to colleagues while allowing for
 semi-independent study of unique topics.
 
 This add-on was developed in the Fall of 2020 by Joseph Policarpio, a then second-year medical student
 at the Carle Illinois College of Medicine. Having fundamental programming experience with Matlab and Visual Basic, he 
 learned the Python programming language in a period of roughly four weeks with the help of free, online resources 
 including instructional YouTube videos from [Tech With Tim](https://www.youtube.com/c/TechWithTim){:target="_blank"} and [Programming
 with Mosh](https://www.youtube.com/c/programmingwithmosh){:target="_blank"}. Many thanks to these outstanding teachers and developers.
 
 Of course, Mr. Policarpio was not alone in his endeavor - several friends and colleagues helped with troubleshooting, graphic user
 interface design,  ideas for functional features, and testing of alpha and beta releases.

## The First Battle 

After weeks of failure the first successful Battle Anki battle took place on November 5, 2020 with Rahul Ramanathan, a great friend and colleague.

Quite obsolete compared to the most recent Battle Anki version! ðŸ¤£
