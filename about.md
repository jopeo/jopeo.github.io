>>- [Image Occlusion Enhanced](https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/1111933094){:target="\_blank"} - to hide parts of an image
>>- [Review Heatmap](https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/1771074083){:target="\_blank"} - to visualize past and future card review activity

# Inspiration

 Battle Anki was created during the COVID-19 pandemic by a second-year medical student in preparation for an upcoming
 dedicated USMLE Step 1 study period. 

# Software Development
 
 In response to the quarantine, this software was developed to improve relatedness to colleagues while allowing for
 semi-independent study of unique topics.
 
 This add-on was developed in the Fall of 2020 by Joseph Policarpio, who at the time was a second-year medical student
 at the Carle Illinois College of Medicine. Having basic programming experience with Matlab and Visual Basic, he 
 learned the Python programming language in a period of roughly four weeks with the help of free, online resources 
 including instructional YouTube videos from [Tech With Tim](https://www.youtube.com/c/TechWithTim){:target="\_blank"} and [Programming
 with Mosh](https://www.youtube.com/c/programmingwithmosh){:target="\_blank"}. Many thanks to these outstanding teachers and developers.
 
 Of course, Mr. Policarpio was not alone in his endeavor - several friends and colleagues were invited to participate
 as **Key Opinion Leaders**, providing help with troubleshooting, suggestions for software implementation, and testing
 of alpha and beta releases.
 
 ### Key Opinion Leaders
 
 There is no greater compliment from a colleague than their willingness to risk their Anki collection. Their help and
 contributions will never be forgotten.
